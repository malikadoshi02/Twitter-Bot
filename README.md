# Twitter-Bot
My bot will be a wellness bot and remind people to do things that are beneficial to their health. For example, “Drink your water”, “Go for a walk”, “Sit up straight”, “Stretch”, “Don't forget your vitamins”. All these tweets will help motivate people and having them sent on a set timer will help people get into a routine. The bot will generate such messages randomly every 2 hours. The messages may repeat, but that is okay because the messages are very general. Meaning, it is okay to print “Stretch” or “Drink your water” multiple times because it is normal for people to do this multiple times in a day.  
 
To create this twitter bot, I will be using simple_twit because it is the tweepy library. To code my bot, I will implement functions using the Status class attributes, User class attributes, and the General functions.  I will also use if statements, for loops, and importantly print statements. Print statements will be followed by a command for the code. This is important because it will print the tweets from the bot. I will also be using variables to store information to avoid small errors. I will be using strings within the code to represent the tweets. I will break down the code into multiple functions to help keep the code for the bot organized. I will also be using Boolean True and False statements to make decisions when a tweet is to be printed.
