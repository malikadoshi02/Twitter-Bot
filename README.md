# Twitter-Bot
My bot will be a wellness bot and remind people to do things that are beneficial to their health. For example, “Drink your water”, “Go for a walk”, “Sit up straight”, “Stretch”, “Don't forget your vitamins”. All these tweets will help motivate people and having them sent on a set timer will help people get into a routine. The bot will generate such messages randomly every 2 hours. The messages may repeat, but that is okay because the messages are very general. Meaning, it is okay to print “Stretch” or “Drink your water” multiple times because it is normal for people to do this multiple times in a day.
